Below are the different states in the tenant lifecycle along with descriptions and suggested parameter names for defining each state in the code:

1. **Initial Onboarding (State: `InitialOnboarding`)**:
   Description: At this stage, basic information about the tenant is collected.
   Parameter Name: `InitialOnboarding`

2. **Initial Onboarding Approval (State: `OnboardingDemo`)**:
   Description: Approval from the Marketing Ops team is obtained to provide an initial application demo.
   Parameter Name: `OnboardingDemo`

3. **Pre-Onboarding Checks (State: `preProvisioningChecks`)**:
   Description: All information is verified for accuracy and approved by the tenant.
   Parameter Name: `preProvisioningChecks`

4. **Trial (State: `Trial`)**:
   Description: Tenants can opt for a trial period, during which a development environment is set up.
   Parameter Name: `Trial`

5. **Trial DEACTIVATED (State: `Deactivated`)**:
   Description: If tenants choose to discontinue the trial, the development environment is inactivated.
   Parameter Name: `Deactivated`

6. **PROVISIONING (State: `PROVISIONING`)**:
   Description: Tenants choose to provision multiple environments including development, user acceptance testing (UAT), and production.
   Parameter Name: `PROVISIONING`

7. **Active (State: `Active`)**:
   Description: Tenants transition to the active state after completing the trial period and opting for the paid version.
